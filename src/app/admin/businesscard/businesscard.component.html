                        <q>I have tried a lot of marketing & logo design programs over the years. I am also usually pretty stingy about paying monthly for things since I am a small business I try to keep a low overhead so I just buy the logos and cancel my subscription.</q>

A simple layout can convey elegance and sophistication, while a more dynamic layout can mean fun or adventure. Search our logo collection for a design then customize it according to your needs. Remember you can also research logos - pay attention to their layout, color choices, design themes and fonts.</p>

You want to use text and a name that describes your business, the caliber of service you provide and one that resonates with customers. If you're stumped, research other companies with logos for inspiration. Remember your logo should have a catchy and non-offensive name that's sits well with the whole team. Try to keep the logo text short and simple using a bold clean font, so it's easily recognisable on your logo.</p>
